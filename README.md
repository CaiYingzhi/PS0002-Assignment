# PS0002-Assignment
Assignment for 2022 Sem 2 Wednesday class

Had written the code and commented for Assignment 1 and Assignment 2.

In my Assignment 2 R file, the definition provided for the Miss Classification Rate as the sum of the False Positive Rate and False Negative Rate is incorrect. Additionally, there may be comments related to Assignment 2 (Lines 125-129) that are incorrect. Please disregard this definition.
